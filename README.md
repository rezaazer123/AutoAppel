The app might crash, always doublecheck that your presence has truly been checked :)


## App configuration ##
To configure the app, open "Settings.txt" and change the mail and password.
Save and close after.


## Launch ##
To launch the app, run the "AutoAppel.py" python file.
It should open Chrome, and start doing some stuff.
Let the window open, you can minimize it if you want.


## Issues ##
If Chrome don't open after running "AutoAppel.py", try to update your Chrome browser to the latest version. (Parameters>About Chrome)

If the "chromedriver.exe" file is outdated, download the latest verison here : https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
Unzip it, grab the "chromedriver.exe" inside and replace the one in "Drivers".

Otherwise, you can send me an email :)
